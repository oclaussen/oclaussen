    summary = ''
      I'm an infrastructure engineer that's happy to tackle any task or challenge thrown at me with a cheerful attitude.
      So far my career has been an odd journey, starting from Software Development, looping through CI/CD and Platform Engineering, SysAdmin and IT, Cloud Infrastructure and SecOps roles.
      I love branching out and never try to stay in my comfort zone, but always try to keep experience from my previous roles alive in an unmanagable amount of unfinished hobby projects.
      While I enjoy getting into new fields and technologies, my skills usually shine when it comes to understanding, debugging and maintaining long term migrations of legacy infrastructure, services or projects.
